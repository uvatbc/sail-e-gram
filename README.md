Telegram for Sailfish

I got tired of waiting for a reasonable native Telegram client for Sailfish and started writing one myself.
Lets see how far this goes.

Requirements:
bzr branch lp:libqtelegram

To compile libqtelegram:
1. Start from ubuntu:14.10
2. apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; apt-get install bzr cppcheck dh-exec cmake ; apt-get build-dep qtcreator
